    "## 🎯 Key Takeaways from the 3 Workflow Demos\n",
    "\n",
    "The three demos above show the complete image ordering workflow in action:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Demo 1 - Auto-Approval Path**: When requests are small (≤1 picture), approval is automatic\n",
    "2. **Demo 2 - Approval with YES**: When requests are large (>1 picture), the agent pauses and waits for human decision. Here the human approves.\n",
    "3. **Demo 3 - Approval with NO**: Same scenario, but the human rejects the large order\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You Learned:**\n",
    "- How the `place_get_pic_order` tool with `SUPPORTED_ORIGINS` handles different image sources\n",
    "- How `tool_context.request_confirmation()` pauses execution waiting for human input\n",
    "- How the workflow resumes with the same `invocation_id` to continue from where it paused\n",
    "- How multiple origins (place_get_pic_order, place_get_pig_order, mcp_images, mcp_images_alt) enable flexible sourcing"
