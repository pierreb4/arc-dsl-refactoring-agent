## Phase 1: Type Annotation System (Section 21)

### Implementation Status: 80% Complete

**Goal:** Add type hints to 400+ solver functions in `arc-dsl/solvers.py` using specialized refactoring agent.

**Components Implemented:**
- [x] Type Annotation Agent (specialized RefactoringAgent)
- [x] Three custom tools:
  - `analyze_solver_types_tool()` - Wraps CLI analyzer, parses output
  - `get_annotation_progress_tool()` - Tracks annotation coverage
  - `get_next_batch_tool()` - Returns unannotated solvers in line range
- [x] HITL workflow: `run_type_annotation_test()`
- [x] Test execution on 10 simplest solvers (lines 5-73)

**Test Results (10 solvers processed):**
- ✅ **Approved:** 8 solvers (80% approval rate)
- 🔄 **Refined:** 1 solver (refinement loop validated)
- ⏭️ **Skipped:** 2 solvers (20% rejection rate)
- ✅ **All HITL paths tested:** approve, refine, skip

**Issues Discovered:**
1. **Critical - File Destruction Bug:** 
   - Regex pattern `rf'(^def {solver_name}\\(I\\):.*?)(^def \\w+\\(|$)'` with `re.DOTALL` matched entire file
   - Each replacement overwrote file with just new function
   - Result: `solvers.py` reduced to 0 bytes
   - **Status:** File recovered via `git restore`, regex fix pending

2. **Agent Hallucination:**
   - Generated complete new implementations instead of just adding type hints
   - Example: Simple `O = vmirror(I)` became 100+ line implementation
   - Root cause: `analyze_solver_types_tool()` returned 0 variables (parsing failure)
   - **Status:** Parser fix needed

3. **Counter Tracking Bug:**
   - Summary showed "Approved: 0, Skipped: 10" instead of actual "8, 1, 2"
   - **Status:** Fixed - counters now accurate

**Fixes Applied:**
- [x] Counter tracking (approved/refined/skipped counts)
- [x] Documentation consolidated into Section 20
- [x] Notebook cleaned up (59 cells, down from 62)

**Fixes Pending:**
- [ ] Regex pattern for safe single-function replacement
- [ ] Parser for `analyze_solver_types.py` output
- [ ] Agent constraint: "DO NOT REWRITE logic, ONLY add type annotations"

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix regex pattern to match only single function scope
2. Fix variable parsing in `analyze_solver_types_tool()`
3. Add "ONLY add type annotations" constraint to agent prompt
4. Re-test on 10 solvers with fixes validated
5. Process remaining 390 solvers once workflow proven safe
6. Validate with pytest that annotations don't break functionality

- Sections 17-18: Final execution & information

**Decisions:**
- Used input() instead of ipywidgets for broader compatibility
- Dict-based implementations instead of full ADK for demonstration clarity
- Gemini 2.0 Flash (adjusted from original 2.5 Flash Lite plan)

## Notes & Learnings

**HITL User Experience:**
- Initial version showed truncated JSON (hard to parse)
- Enhanced version extracts key info, formats hierarchically
- Abort option essential for long sessions
- User feedback: clearer decisions lead to better approval rates

**Implementation Insights:**
- JSON parsing from LLM output requires robust error handling
- Always provide fallback to raw text display
- Prioritize information display (top N) prevents overwhelming user
- Consistent formatting across workflow modes reduces confusion
